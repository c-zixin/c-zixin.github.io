## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(shiny)

# Define UI ----

  titlePanel("Rate the Attributes!"),
  
  tags$style(HTML(".pink-background { background-color: #FFB6C1; }")),
