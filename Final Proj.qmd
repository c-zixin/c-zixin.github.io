## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(
  Feature = c("Kind Eyes", "Sweet Voice", "Perfect Hair"),
  Score = c(5, 4, 3)
) 

# Define UI ----
ui <- fluidPage(titlePanel ("What makes an ideal partner?"),
sidebarLayout(
                  position = "left",
                  sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
                  mainPanel(h1("Introduction"),
                            h6("Have you ever thought of what makes your ideal partner?
                               Does he or she have the kindest eyes, 
                               the sweetest voice or perhaps the most perfect hair?"), 
                  plotOutput("featurePlot"))
                
))
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Create a ggplot2 plot
  output$featurePlot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(data, aes(x = Feature, y = Score)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      labs(x = "Feature", y = "Score") +
      theme_minimal()
  })
}

# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
