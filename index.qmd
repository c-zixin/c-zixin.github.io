title: Self Introduction

Hi I am Chen Zi Xin, a year 1 student studying Industrial Design in College of Design and Engineering in NUS! Three words to describe me would be hardworking, empathetic and sociable. In my free time, I enjoy solving puzzles and film photography as well as playing badminton. I am quite extroverted, it is no challenge for me to initiate a conversation with strangers but of course there are things that scares me too. I hope to graduate with at least a second class honor and tons of good memories and friends!
